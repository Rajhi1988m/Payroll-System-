# Payroll-System

In this mini-project, it designed and implemented a payroll system using an abstract base class. 
The aim is to emphasize design using an abstract base class and to practice how to implement it in a programming language such as C++ accurately. 
It designed and wrote processes payroll data for a collection of employees. Employees are either salaried or hourly. At the end of the month, salaried employees receive a fixed pay. 
Hourly employees, nevertheless, receive pay that is determined by their hourly rate times the actual hours worked. 
The payroll system will print out the last name of each employee along with the pay due to the employee, separated by a space. This mimics a tangible payroll system, that utilizes this information actually to print and cut the checks.
